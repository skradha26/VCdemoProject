# VCdemoProject

Assumption for the demo:  an individual or organisation with their own DID will hold the verifiable credential created 
                          for the digital asset
                         
                        
Upcoming update:
1) Move issuer and subject key pair generation to separate files
2) Separate issuer and subject/holder agent or code
2) Verify form allows user to upload the credential to be verified from a file
3) Verify proof needs a form 
4) Use multiple signatures to sign the presentation so that a proof set can be created in the credential
   This will be useful to transfer custody of a design flow or any digital asset from one individual or
   organisation to another
5) Stronger and more secure challenge parameter needs to be used for proof verification
